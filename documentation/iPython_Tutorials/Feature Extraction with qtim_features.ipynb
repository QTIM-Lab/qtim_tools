    "## Grey-Level Co-Occurence Matrix (GLCM) Texture Features\n",
    "\n",
    "Grey-Level Co-Occurence Matrices (GLCMs) offer the ability to calculate simple texture measure defined by the differences in intensity from one voxel to the next. We will be calculating 2-D GLCMs on each slice of a particular region of interest, and then aggregating those slices into one summary GLCM. From there, we can extract other texture features, such as \"Contrast,\" \"Dissmilarity\", \"Homogeneity\", and \"Correlation\". These features are derived from matrix calculations on the GLCM extracted from a given ROI.\n",
    "\n",
    "Depending on the distance and angle that one calculates a GLCM from, the features extracted can be quite different. A GLCM can be calculated from the difference between voxels right next to each other (distance: 1) and derive features that are very sensitive to fine-grain, heavily-textured regions of interest. Another GLCM can be calculated from the difference between intensities several voxels apart (distance: 5-10) to create features sensitive to thicker, heavily-edged images. \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"./Example_Images/GLCM_Distance.png\">\n",
    "\n",
    "Different angles can also result in different features. A GLCM can be calculated based on the intensity difference between voxels located on top of and below each other (angle: 90 degrees), ending up with texture features very sensitive to horizontally-oriented bars of intensity. Similarly, a focus on voxels located to the right and left of each other (angle: 0 degrees) will be sensitive to vertically-oriented texture, but not horizontal texture. Other non-cardinal angles (e.g. angle: 45 degrees) can be used to detect other orientations of texture.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"./Example_Images/GLCM_Angle.png\">\n",
    "\n",
    "Without getting into the specifics of the equations used to extract features from GLCMs, different features reflect different visual qualities of a region of interest. For example, \"Contrast\" is particularly sensitive to stark differences between bright and dark intensities (e.g. at a tumor border), whereas \"Dissimilarity\" better reflects heterogeneity in voxel intensity across an entire region of interest. Other features attempt to represent other visual qualities; you can learn more at this link: http://www.fp.ucalgary.ca/mhallbey/texture_calculations.htm\n",

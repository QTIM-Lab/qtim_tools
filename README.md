# qtim_tools
This is a repository for QTIM image processing utilties written in Python. More details coming soon!

This directory has yet to be put in a package. However, you can download this entire repository and run

python -m qtim_tools.qtim_features.learner
python -m qtim_tools.qtim_dce.tofts_parameter_calculator

To test some of the programs. Unfortunately, they are not yet linked to the test data, so will you will have to edit the source files yourself. Usability changes coming!

# Digital Reference Objects for Shape, Size, Intensity, and GLCM Features

These folders contain digital reference objects (DROs) for shape, size, intensity, and GLCM features. Folders prepended with the label "Phantom" are non-anatomical DROs, while folders prepended with "MRHead" are label-based DROs overlaid on sample MR data from a brain.

MRHead volumes originated as sample data in the open-source imaging Platform 3D Slicer. https://www.slicer.org/wiki/SampleData
